"Thank you AOC! Also, some words of wisdom from a Christ-like figure who wants the best for everyone in America:

- “There is no separation of church and state. It’s a fabrication, it’s a fiction, it’s not in the constitution. It’s made up by secular humanists.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 6, 2022  
  *Context: Kirk dismissed the constitutional principle of church–state separation, framing it as an invention of secular humanists.*  

- “If you’re a WNBA, pot-smoking, Black lesbian, do you get treated better than a United States marine?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Dec 8, 2022  
  *Context: He mocked Brittney Griner’s release from Russian custody, contrasting her with U.S. military personnel.*  

- “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights. That is a prudent deal. It is rational.” – TPUSA Faith event, Apr 5, 2023  
  *Context: At a Turning Point USA Faith event, he argued that recurring gun deaths are an acceptable trade-off to preserve Second Amendment rights.*  

- “Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, May 19, 2023  
  *Context: Kirk described Black people as predatory and violent, pushing a racist stereotype about interracial crime.*  

- “If we would have said that Joy Reid and Michelle Obama and Sheila Jackson Lee and Ketanji Brown Jackson were affirmative action picks, we would have been called racists. Now they’re coming out and they’re saying it for us … You do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously. You had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jul 13, 2023  
  *Context: He attacked Black women leaders, claiming they only advanced due to affirmative action and lacked intellectual ability.*  

- “If I’m dealing with somebody in customer service who’s a moronic Black woman, I wonder is she there because of her excellence, or is she there because of affirmative action?” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 3, 2024  
  *Context: Kirk questioned whether a Black woman in customer service was competent, or just a token hire under affirmative action.*  

- “If I see a Black pilot, I’m going to be like, boy, I hope he’s qualified.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jan 23, 2024  
  *Context: He implied Black professionals, including pilots, are suspect hires whose competence should be doubted.*  

- “The great replacement strategy, which is well under way every single day in our southern border, is a strategy to replace white rural America with something different.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 1, 2024  
  *Context: Kirk invoked the white nationalist “Great Replacement” conspiracy, claiming immigration is designed to displace white Americans.*  

- “The American Democrat party hates this country. They wanna see it collapse. They love it when America becomes less white.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Mar 20, 2024  
  *Context: He accused Democrats of deliberately pushing demographic change to weaken America and reduce its white population.*  

- “We need to have a Nuremberg-style trial for every gender-affirming clinic doctor. We need it immediately.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 1, 2024  
  *Context: He compared gender-affirming care to war crimes, calling for doctors to face trials modeled on Nazi prosecutions.*  

- “The answer is yes, the baby would be delivered.” – Surrounded debate show, Sep 8, 2024  
  *Context: Asked if he would allow his 10-year-old daughter to have an abortion if raped, Kirk replied no — the child would be forced to give birth.*  

- “America has freedom of religion, of course, but we should be frank: large dedicated Islamic areas are a threat to America.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Apr 30, 2025  
  *Context: He framed Muslim communities as inherently dangerous, arguing they pose a national security threat.*  

- “We’ve been warning about the rise of Islam on the show, to great amount of backlash. We don’t care, that’s what we do here. And we said that Islam is not compatible with western civilization.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Jun 24, 2025  
  *Context: Kirk declared Islam fundamentally incompatible with Western values and civilization.*  

- “America was at its peak when we halted immigration for 40 years and we dropped our foreign-born percentage to its lowest level ever. We should be unafraid to do that.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 22, 2025  
  *Context: He praised the early 20th-century era of immigration restriction and advocated for shutting down immigration again.*  

- “Reject feminism. Submit to your husband, Taylor. You’re not in charge.” – The Charlie Kirk Show, Aug 26, 2025  
  *Context: In response to news of Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce, he told her to abandon feminism and obey her husband.*  

- “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.” – Charlie Kirk social media post, Sep 8, 2025  
  *Context: On social media, he claimed Islam is being weaponized by the political left to destroy the United States.*",539,1nonj9g

"As [Donald Trump](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?ico=in-line_link) hailed “the golden age of America” at the UN General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, tensions between the US and United Nations were palpable.

[The President](https://inews.co.uk/news/science/what-science-says-autism-why-trump-wrong-3932354?ico=in-line_link) highlighted “historic trade deals” with the UK and others, and claimed the US was respected “like it has never been respected before” – but the response was embarrassing.

There was [scattered awkward laughter in the room](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/uk-politics-latest-updates-live-5-3930091?ico=in-line_link) as he jokingly complained about a broken escalator and teleprompter at the UN – and a lack of marble floors. UN officials and experts have warned that Trump’s combative approach to the organisation could lead to a waning of US influence.

Since the start of the year, Trump has moved to slash US funding of the UN, withdrawn from many of its agencies, and ordered a review of America’s interactions with the organisation.

His actions have exacerbated the UN’s already significant budget crisis and created space for nations including China to expand their influence.

“US credibility and influence as a reliable partner and as a state broadly committed to human rights and international peace and security is suffering badly,” Phil Lynch, executive director of the non-profit International Service for Human Rights, told *The i Paper*.

“Trump on the international level has an agenda which very much mirrors his agenda at the domestic level, which is one of the suppression of dissent, the erosion of accountability mechanisms and the subversion of the rule of law.

“His agenda at the UN in terms of the withdrawal of funding and denunciation of treaties follows a very similar pattern.”",2290,1nok4av

">A family in Leominster, Massachusetts is accusing US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents of holding a 5-year-old autistic girl outside their home last week in an attempt to pressure her immigrant father to surrender to federal authorities.

>Footage of the incident was [published](https://www.telemundonuevainglaterra.com/noticias/local/ice-arresto-leominster/2524370/) Monday by NBCUniversal’s Spanish-language *Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra*. The video shows the little girl seated outside an open vehicle, drinking from a water bottle while surrounded by law enforcement.

>In the video, a man can be heard shouting “Don’t touch her!” and a woman identified as the girl’s mother tells one agent that the others took her daughter, who is 5 years old and on the autism spectrum. She also says, “Give me my daughter back.”

>The mother, who did not want her name shared, told *Telemundo* that her husband, 22-year-old Edward Hip, called her while driving with their daughter because he thought they were being followed. When they tried to return home, agents grabbed the child.

>[According to](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/ice-agents-held-5-year-old-girl-outside-leominster-home-to-get-father-to-surrender-family-says/3813686/) *NBC Boston*, “Leominster police arrived at the scene, recovered the child, and returned her to the family.”

>Neither parent was taken into custody that day. However, two days later, on his wife’s birthday, ICE returned to their home, pulled Hip out of a car, and arrested him, she said. He is now being held at a detention center in Plymouth.

>*NBC Boston* reported that Hip and his wife, who are from Guatemala, “have an active asylum claim and are the parents of two children born in the United States.”

>While ICE has not responded to Telemundo’s request for comment, the footage has sparked swift outrage, with critics across the United States and beyond condemning agents’ treatment of the family as “fascism,” ”[truly evil](https://x.com/JonathanCohn/status/1970448688838308034),” and ”[a fucking abomination](https://bsky.app/profile/capecodcritter.bsky.social/post/3lzj5nauk7c2l).”

>Joanna Kuebler, chief of programs at the advocacy group America’s Voice, said in a Tuesday statement: “That ICE would try to hold hostage a parent’s love for a child to force a father’s arrest and detention is abhorrent. This visceral event is just another frightening example of a broader and deeply disturbing pattern by this administration.”

>“The combination of cruelty and impunity in pursuit of a mass deportation crusade is dangerous for America and all of our safety,” Kuebler added. “Smashing car windows, ripping families apart, and traumatizing children threatens the public safety of American communities and the stability of our nation.”

This is deeply disturbing and exactly an example that shows the Trump administration's Nazi-like immigration enforcement.  We are seeing ICE acting more and more like the secret police and the cruelty is increasing in both frequency and severity.",1,1nov0uw

"News snippets; BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Tuesday called for a criminal investigation against U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials involved in this month’s deadly strikes on boats in the Caribbean that the White House has said were transporting drugs.

Petro repudiated the three attacks in his speech at the annual meeting of the U.N. General Assembly during which he also accused Trump of criminalizing poverty and migration.

“Criminal proceedings must be opened against those officials, who are from the U.S., even if it includes the highest-ranking official who gave the order: President Trump,” Petro said of the strikes, adding that boat passengers were not members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang as claimed by the Trump administration after the first attack.

If the boats were carrying drugs as alleged by the U.S. government, Petro said, their passengers “were not drug traffickers; they were simply poor young people from Latin America who had no other option.”",1,1np08wu

"American Jews as a demographic are mostly Ashkenazim, meaning their families came to the US from Eastern European countries. Jews in America have largely been a part of the Democratic coalition since the New Deal. Prominent left-wing Israeli politicians like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir were also Ashkenazi and coming from socialist countries in the USSR may have influenced that. American Jews are also highly educated (which correlates with voting left-wing in the US) and are concentrated in states like blue states like New York, Illinois, and California, and purple states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Florida.

The majority of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi, which means their family came to Israel from Middle Eastern/Arab countries (or have lived in Israel for several generations). These voters, who experienced living in Arab countries are much more security minded and have experienced/heard stories of the persecution of Jews in Arab lands. One of the reasons that Israel went from having socialist leadership early on like Ben Gurion and Golda Meir, to conservative leadership like Sharon and Netanyahu is that Israel's early immigrants were Ashkenazi and over decades the country grew from Jewish immigrants being kicked out of Muslim countries like Yemen, Iraq, Morroco and migrating to Israel.

Trump is popular in Israel because he is viewed as being unapologetically pro-Israel and pro-Israeli security. He recognized Israeli annexation of the Golan, moved the US embassy to Jerusalem (de-facto recognizing it as Israel's capitol), and has been supportive of the war against Hamas in Gaza (for example Trump negotiated directly with Hamas on the release of an American Israeli captive Edan Alexander). Jews in Israel, receive the benefits of Trump's foreign policy without having to endure his Domestic policy. American Jews are socially liberal, and while many are supportive of Israel, they are more affected by Domestic US policy and vote left for social/economic reasons (abortion is overwhelmingly accepted in Judaism for example).",415,1nnpbbf
"I think it should be mentioned the out sized political power Orthodox Jews world in Israel compared to elsewhere. They are very populous and yet don't have to serve in the military, afaik. They are in general much more in favor of military action than their Israeli counterparts, and yet have no stake in the game.",26,1nnpbbf
"1. Israel is a far-right society radicalized by decades of conflict. The Jews there grow up in that environment. The Jews here don't, if anything they grow up in very much the opposite of that environment here: peaceful progressive diverse cities like NYC. They haven't grown up in perpetual conflict. A demagogue like Trump is perfect for a country like Israel, Bibi himself is like an Israeli Trump.

2. American Jews can smell the Republican antisemitism from like a mile away. Israeli Jews live in a majority Jewish country where parties across the spectrum are dominated by Jews, they don't really have an issue with antisemitism in their politics, so they can vote as far-right as they want without having to fear antisemitism.",70,1nnpbbf
"The American Evangelican Christian Right has promoted Israel since the 1970s. The Modern Evangelical Movement is highly Millennialist meaning that its very apocalyptic in a very immediate sense. This strain of Christianity stresses that the end times are going to happen any time now, or that they've already begun and we are now living through their opening stages. This idea creates an immediacy to their faith, that they must get right with God right now *or else.* In their interpretation of the End Times Israel is central to everything that will signal the Anti-Christ and the 1000 years of darkness will occur! In the Jewish Bible *Israel* refers to the Jewish People in covenant with their God, and in the New Testament it refers to the People of God which is anyone who's Christian who's soul is saved. The Evangelical Right has identified the State of Israel, which identifies itself as the nation of the Jewish People, as being their biblical Israel. 

So in a case of strange bed fellows many Evangelical Americans pushed for the US Government to become much more Pro-Israel and much more pro-active in supplying them weapons and regional support. They pushed really hard for about a decade for an American presidential candidate who was openly Pro-Christianity, Pro-""Family Values"", and importantly Pro-Israel. Haaaaaaaaaaaaave you met Ronald Reagan? The Reagan Administration leapt into partnering with Israel, even overlooking cases of Israeli espionage and industrial spying, treating it like another front in the global Cold War. 

Donald Trump is the inheritor of the American Political Right's need to promote Israel for their End of Days prophecies to come true. The Evangelical Right was an early and enthusiastic adopter of Donald J Trump because he made early and enthusiastic overtures to their leaders, who promoted him as The Man who was going to save the soul of America, right all of the wrongs, and who would stand up for their brand of Christianity in a forceful and open manner. I doubt Trump himself, as a private individual, has much regard or interest in Israel. He's reportedly called Jewish People who've worked for him (or who he's butted heads with) some remarkably un-politically correct nick names. Before his Presidency he had no great affinity with the Jewish community of New York as far as I can tell. 

But if he's to be the Defender of the Evangelical Christian Right and its cause, then promoting Israel and protecting it is of course what he's always been in favor of!",24,1nnpbbf

"I think the toughest part of this is the methods section. Oppressed people (black, indigenous, LGBTQA+, or what have you) do have a duty to resist as do their fellow citizens have a duty to resist in their defense.

However, as to methods, any framework you arrive at can and will be used by whomever your opponents are. MAGA thinks they are oppressed. They think of themselves are the aggrieved party. I don’t agree with that at all but they do hence Trumps retribution messaging in 2020. 

To use a recent example, Harry Reid ended the use of the filibuster for most presidential nominations (except the Supreme Court) over the objection of Mitch McConnell who promised Republicans would end up taking it a step further if Reid followed through. Republicans later took over the Senate and McConnell announced he was getting rid of the filibuster on judges at the Supreme Court level too leading to Trumps 3 picks. By shattering a norm democrats left themselves open. 

Going back to Rome, if you want a classical example, once minor violence started being allowed near the Senate it escalated until there were basically riots and warring factions killing each other which intern led to their civil war. (this is an oversimplification. Read “the storm before the storm” for a better yelling).

">Do oppressed groups have a duty, not just a right, to resist systemic threats, and if so, what methods are justified?

I would say that the ""right"" to resist is self-evident, even if it may not be specifically codified into law.  It's not unlike the right to defend oneself if physically assaulted by a violent attacker.  

Whether that translates into an actual ""duty"" is another matter.  Some religions might say one should ""turn the other cheek"" and not fight back.  Some might say ""Let yourself be killed, but do not kill.""",1,1nmo35z

"There are a couple of pretty simple approaches. 

Number one is to make capital gains tax rates equal to income tax rates. This notion that the money you make on money is somehow different than income is inherently unfair and favors the wealthy tremendously. 

Number two is to focus more on corporate rates than personal ones. The biggest tax avoidance in the nation is corporate. We often see citations about how high tax rates were under Eisenhower but rarely do we see that specifically mentioned in regard to corporations. Individuals have natural limitations on how they can avoid taxation but companies can easily minimize their tax burden by putting excess profit to work within the company and taking it off the profit margin. Facilities, salaries, research and development are all reinvestment strategies that would help the company and the economy at large without necessarily increasing tax revenue massively. 

We think of the “fair share” terminology in individual terms but all of the richest people are only so wealthy because of their asset value as major shareholders in massive companies. By using tax policy to encourage reinvestment, those individuals would automatically be “worth” less but their companies would be making a more beneficial contribution to the economy on broad terms",11,1nm2c8v

On the national stage, leaders like Warren, Sanders, and Murphy are pushing back. At the state and regional level, people like Newsom, Pritzker, and Moore — along with countless Democratic mayors — are showing what real leadership looks like and setting examples for the rest of the country.

That’s what we need: strong voices at every level — national, statewide, and local — all working to protect our democracy. For me, the priority isn’t rallying behind one single “leader.” It’s recognizing that we already have a lot of leaders, and supporting all of them in this fight.",40,1nkroke
"I'd say the Democrats appear leaderless.

Obviously this far from a presidential election, there's no White House contender, who would naturally become the leader of the party.

So what you have is the legislature, led by Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, who appear to be hapless and feckless. I think there's a good chance Jeffries actually loses his seat to a primary challenger in the midterms (see, Eric Cantor).

There's Sanders, AOC and (to a much lesser extent) Crockett who are more in touch with the Democratic base but aren't in leadership roles, but actually seem to be willing to fight Trump in a way the actual leadership are squeamish of.

Finally, there's state governors. Newsom is the most obviously trying to step into a leadership role and getting the appropriate media coverage. Pritzker is the other obvious option - I think a lot of the reason Trump backed away from his ""confrontation"" with Chicago is feeding Pritzker a win that would give him a massive boost on the national stage.

But no-one is really there now, and that's part of the reason the Democratic party's popularity is so low. They might even do better by wheeling out Pelosi again, who could at least look like a leader.",42,1nkroke

"Humans think in terms of stories. It's basic psychology.

Think through your day yesterday, everything you did from when you got up to when you went to bed. It was probably pretty easy. Now do that again but think *backwards,* starting from when you went to bed to when you woke up. It's doable but it takes more thought.

Your memories are organized as stories in your brain and stories feel more relatable to us. We can see ourselves in them, we can see people we know in them.

Statistics is interesting but you have to put a *face* on statistics for people to really resonate with them.

It's why hearing that 5,000 people died in such-and-such a catastrophe is bad but then you see a memorial for those people where someone set out 5,000 pairs of shoes and it hits a lot harder. 5,000 is numbers on a page or a screen - it's big but it's kind of abstract. Staring at 5,000 pairs of shoes knowing each one used to be a person is a lot more visceral for people.",22,1nkwxla
"\>Doctors’ groups pushing for Medicare-for-All leaned on personal stories and human experiences. Insurance and hospital-backed groups leaned on charts, stats, and technical terms. Guess which one resonated more on Twitter?

Stories are great in pulling at heart strings. That doesn't equal votes at the ballot box",5,1nkwxla
"I’d like to use a powerful storytelling concept from the movie 10,000 BC to illustrate how we assign meaning and importance to information, particularly, why some things stick with us while others are forgotten.

In the film, the character Tic’Tic tells a story to D’Leh, the young hero:

*“A good man draws a circle around himself and cares for those within, his woman, his children. Other men draw a larger circle and bring within their brothers and sisters. But some men have a great destiny. They must draw around themselves a circle that includes many, many more. Your father was one of those men. You must decide for yourself whether you are, as well.”*

This story resonates because it taps into something deeply human, we all draw mental ""circles"" around the people and things we care about. These circles define the emotional relevance of our memories and experiences.

In modern society, most people naturally draw larger circles, including family, close friends, and maybe a few others. Very few people draw circles large enough to encompass strangers, distant communities, or the world at large.

This is where storytelling becomes so powerful.

When we hear a statistic, our brain tends to treat it as abstract, unless it affects someone within our circle. It is treated with no more importance than the 10,000 other numbers surrounding us thoughout the average day.

But here’s the key, when we hear a story, our minds instinctively start casting roles. We imagine the characters, and without even realizing it, we paste familiar faces, people from our own lives, onto them. A mother in the story becomes our mother. A struggling child becomes someone we know. This mental substitution brings the story into our circle, and with that, it gains emotional importance.

That’s why stories are remembered when statistics are not. They move from the abstract to the personal. They resonate emotionally. They stick.",3,1nkwxla
"Statistics is impersonal, and in a way dehumanizes the population it describes. It's almost like the larger the number casualties there are, the more likely we are to feel nothing at all (Gaza?). As if we have passed the limit of empathy, and we just feel very little.

Anecdotes and personal stories are things that people can relate to. They can attempt share in the experience. The narrow scope of the story leaves plenty of room for empathy to kick in. Adding more casualties to the story is not as significant as adding emotive details. COVID victim in their deathbed while their toddler holds their hand is worth more politically than a news report that cites 100 deaths due to COVID.

The result of this nonsense is that policy tends to be driven by anecdotes that get emotional responses rather than more meaningful population statistics and trends. Because politicians need votes and people are dumb and vote with their hearts rather than their brains.

Ultimately, this is a Critical Thinking issue (particularly availability bias). Which makes it an education issue. Which means we are probably doomed.",2,1nkwxla

“After getting to know and fully understand the Ukraine/Russia Military and Economic situation and, after seeing the Economic trouble it is causing Russia, I think Ukraine, with the support of the European Union, is in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form. With time, patience, and the financial support of Europe and, in particular, NATO, the original Borders from where this War started, is very much an option. Why not? Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like ""a paper tiger."" When the people living in Moscow, and all of the Great Cities, Towns, and Districts all throughout Russia, find out what is really going on with this War, the fact that it's almost impossible for them to get Gasoline through the long lines that are being formed, and all of the other things that are taking place in their War Economy, where most of their money is being spent on fighting Ukraine, which has Great Spirit, and only getting better, Ukraine would be able to take back their Country in its original form and, who knows, maybe even go further than that! Putin and Russia are in BIG Economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act. In any event, I wish both Countries well.

Sure, Russia can keep throwing meat at the grinder, but Ukraine can also keeping hitting oil refineries and substations for years as well. And Ukrainians have a real reason to fight, Russians do not.

Trump is reading the tea leaves.  6 months ago, Trump told Zelenskyy ""You don't have the cards"".  And Trump wasn't completely wrong at the time.  Ukraine was getting pushed back repeatedly.  To this day, Russia is still gaining Ukrainian territory every month.  

  
But now that Russian momentum seems to be slowing.  Ukraine is hitting back hard at Russia with homegrown weapons that are targeting the lifeblood of the Russian economy.  Russia is being forced to react and spread already low anti-air supplies even thinner.  This has allowed Ukraine to ""pop Russia in the jaw"" a few times.  Until some new flavor is introduced, Russia doesn't appear to have an answer for this recent Ukrainian counterattack.  Russia's economy is in tatters and the military is stalled and aimless.  Whatever Ukraine has done in the last 6 months, they seem to have found ""some cards""

  
Now is absolutely not the time to allow Russia to fly in on ""protected routes"" using NATO airspace.  I agree with Trump on this issue.  These drones/planes blatantly violating airspace should be shot down.  It is Russia's responsibility to not fly military aircraft over hostile airspace on a whim.",1,1np3d8z

Zelenskyy seems to think China is on the fence and they are not committed to peace because they could end the war right now if they stopped supporting Russia, especially by not buying Russian petroleum products. Russia is now dependent on China for survival.
